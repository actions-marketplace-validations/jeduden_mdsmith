summary: >-
  Create the public cue/cuelite package — the Value type, the
  CUE delegation pattern, the differential harness (in-house
  path versus the CUE-backed path as oracle), and the benchmark.
  Surface façade methods and call-site migration come in the

# cuelite phase 0 — package, façade, and differential harness

## Goal

Stand up the public `cue/cuelite` package as a CUE-backed
scaffold. Add the differential harness and benchmark the later
phases rely on.

## Context

Phase 0 of [plan 218](218_wasm-size-reduction.md); see it for
the full design and strategy. The façade will mirror the CUE
calls mdsmith makes, each delegating to `cuelang.org/go`. Its
methods are added in the per-surface phases. Behaviour matches
CUE, so adopting it later stays green.

## Tasks

1. Create `cue/cuelite` with its `Value` type (wrapping a
   `cue.Value`), the CUE delegation pattern, and path-tagged
   errors. Surface façade methods (`ParsePath`, `Compile`,
   `Unify`, …) are added in their own phases. One unit test per
   function.
2. Build the differential harness: run a value or expression
   through the in-house path and the CUE-backed path, and
   assert identical accept/reject and error field-paths. There
   is no in-house path yet, so it starts as a scaffold.
3. Add the `cue/cuelite`-versus-CUE benchmark.
4. Register `cue/cuelite` in the
   [layering map](../docs/development/architecture/index.md).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `cue/cuelite` is a public, exported, documented package
      with its `Value` type and delegation scaffold.
- [x] Each function ships with a dedicated unit test.
- [x] The differential harness and the benchmark run in CI.
- [x] No mdsmith call site imports `cue/cuelite` yet.
- [x] All tests pass: `go test ./...`
- [x] `go tool golangci-lint run` reports no issues.

## Implementation notes

Two choices differ from the sketch in plan 218:

- **Per-`Value` context, not a shared package context.** An
  earlier draft compiled every `Value` against one package-wide
  `*cue.Context`. Code review rejected it: CUE v0.16.1 documents
  that values from one `Context` are not safe for concurrent use
  and that long-lived contexts grow unbounded, so a single
  process-wide context is both a data race and a memory leak.
  Instead each `Compile`/`CompileJSON` owns a fresh `*cue.Context`
  and keeps its source bytes; `Unify` rebuilds the operand's
  source inside the receiver's context so unification stays
  single-context and two `Value`s never share mutable CUE state.
  This is the honest interim cost — one context per compiled
  `Value`, one re-derive of the operand per `Unify`. The flip to
  the in-house engine drops contexts entirely, with no API change:
  `Value` is a value type whose `Unify` takes and returns a
  `Value`, and a bottom (⊥) absorbs in either implementation.
- **Harness lives in `internal/cuelitetest`, not under
  `cue/cuelite/`.** An earlier draft put it in a public
  `cue/cuelite/difftest` sub-package. Code review rejected that
  too: the harness imports `cuelang.org/go` from non-test files,
  so as a public package it would let external users depend on a
  package plan 218 phase 4 deletes, and it would pin `cuelang.org`
  into `go.mod` even after the flip. Moving it under `internal/`
  keeps it importable by every module test, invisible outside the
  module, and freely deletable. It exposes `CueLitePath` (the
  in-house path), `OraclePath` (the CUE oracle), `Run` over a
  `Case` corpus, and a CI-visible `TestRun_corpus`. Each `Outcome`
  carries a `Stage` discriminator (compile-schema / compile-data /
  validate / accepted / error) so a schema the in-house engine
  cannot parse can never look like agreement with an oracle that
  merely rejected the data.

The phase-0 surface is small. It has `Compile`, `CompileJSON`,
`Value.Unify`, and `Value.Validate`, all on a value-type `Value`
that carries a bottom (⊥) for compile failures so a nil receiver
never panics. `Validate` returns one `*PathError` per failing leaf
(joined with `errors.Join` when several fail), each tagged with
its field path printed exactly once. The `PathError` type exports
`Path` and `Error`; its constructor is unexported, since no caller
outside the package builds one. The rest of the façade arrives in
the per-surface phases.
